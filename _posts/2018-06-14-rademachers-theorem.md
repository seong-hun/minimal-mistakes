## Definition

Consider the first order, scalar PDE
\\[ F(x, u, \nabla u) = 0,\quad x \in \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, \\]
and the boundary condition
\\[ u(x) = \bar{u}(x),\quad x \in \partial \Omega. \\]
Then, a function $u$ is a generallized solution to the PDE if $u$ is Lipschitz continuous
on the closure $\bar{\Omega}$, takes the given boundary condition and satisfies the
first order equation at almost every point $x \in \Omega$.
